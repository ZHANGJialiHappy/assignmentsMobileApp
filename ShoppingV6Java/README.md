# ShoppingV6Java

This folder contains the source code for Version 6 of the Shoopping add.

The new concepts (compared to earlier versions of the Shopping app) are: 

 - Using a RecyclerView for displaying the shopping list which is scrollable
 - Using a customized View to display each shopping item
 - Making each View (displaying on shopping item) clickable. Clicking on an item will delete it

As indicated in the file name, this version is in Java.
